description:
 This check scans for access logs generated by common web servers.
 Currently Tomcat, Apache and Nginx are supported.
 It scans the last requests and sums up the number of requests per
 HTTP response code.
 
 You need to install the plugin {access_logs.py} (Python 3) or 
 {access_logs_2.py} (Python 2) into the {plugins} directory of your
 agent. On the target machine, the shell command {tac} must be present.

 The check gets critical if you configured a maximum failure rate.
 By default, the check only collects the metrics and runs OK
 The failure rate can be configured via a WATO rule. The agent bakery
 is supported.

inventory:
 One service will be created for each discovered log file pattern
 on the target machine. Log file rotation & renaming will be considered.
